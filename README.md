# Boston-bike-rides-duration

In this data science project, I leveraged data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict the duration of bike rides in Boston.
The primary aim was to develop a predictive model that could assist bike-sharing companies and users 
in estimating how long a bike ride would take, helping with trip planning and resource allocation.
I used historical bike rides data, combined it with weather data from Boston to obtain better predictive performance. 
Achieved a predictive model with an MSE of 7 minutes, demonstrating its ability to accurately forecast ride durations.
